/*
This class represents a generic way for an item in the user interface, whether 
it be a game component or 2D or 3D item, to conduct a behavior. By design, it 
can run itself, with a Run action, can take action over time using its Update 
action, can cleanup any items when it is finished using Dispose, and can 
determine when it is completed with its IsFinished action. Behavior itself 
does not do anything itself, but is heavily subclassed for specific kinds of 
actions. 

The classes that use Behaviors of one kind or another the most are the user 
interface controls, like Button, TextBox, or others, and the InputTable class. 
Together, these classes provide a way to efficiently route user input throughout 
the system.

    /*
        When an action is taken with this Behavior, run is called. For example, 
        if a button is clicked in the user interface, Run would be called.

    /*
        Behaviors can optionally be set to Update on every frame of a running 
        program, depending on context. By default, however, not all behaviors do this. 
        For example, in a button, Update is never called on its default behavior, just 
        Run. In contrast, if you call AddBehavior on an item, Update would be called on
        every frame.

        Dispose does nothing by default, but can be overridden to conduct 
        cleanup actions when a behavior is finished. Note that, as discussed in 
        the comment for the Update action, Dispose is only called if the behavior 
        is added through AddBehavior, not if its set as a default Behavior on an 
        interface element (e.g., a Buttonâ€™s default clicking behavior).
