This class stores the values that will be used by the class ConvexConvexFace.
This class contains a vertex of a simplex (you can think of a simplex as an umbrella term for a point, a line, a triangle, or a tetrahedron)
and a vector that is pointing toward the origin from the face that the current ConvexConvexVertex is a part of.
