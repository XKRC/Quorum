This class contains a integer that stores the index of the LocalCollisionPoints3D that
you are interested in in an array of LocalCollisionPoints3Ds. This class also contains another
integer that stores which CollisionPoint3D inside that LocalCollisionPoints3D of interest that

This class is helpful in solving for impulses that will resolve collisions for a collision group
in the CollisionSolver3D class.
